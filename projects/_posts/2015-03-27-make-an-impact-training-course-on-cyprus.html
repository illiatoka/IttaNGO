    <p>Make an Impact! is a training course that took place in Larnaca, Cyprus between 27 March- 2 April 2015. The non-formal educational activity was organised in cooperation with  SEAL CYPRUS, the Cyprus Organisation for Sustainable Education and Active Learning.</p>

    <p>The project brought together youth workers and youth leaders from 11 European countries in order to explore ways to increase the impact of their projects within their organisations and their communities. The participants were guided to extend the potentials of non-formal education methods and techniques in creating original projects to address the needs of young people. Special focus has been given to the use of information communication technologies in order  to efficiently coordinate local and international and  multiply their impact. The participants were trained to use open source software and social media in order to maximize influence of youth work within their organisations and beyond. A guide for dissemination and exploitation of results was created with  contribution of all the trainees.</p>

    <p>Augmenting their skills, the participants are expected to make a better utilization of non- formal education and to raise the visibility of their projects more effectively. This way they will support their own target groups, in particular young people with fewer opportunities (i.e. young people from remote or rural areas, young people in unemployment) in becoming more visible.</p>

    <p>The outcome of the training is expected to have a strong multiplication effect. All participating organisations are currently actively using knowledge they gained during the project.</p>
