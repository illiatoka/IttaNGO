    <p>ARTrepreneuership was a training course aimed to promote Entrepreneurship among the youth. It was held in Larnaca, Cyprus, between 1-7 April 2016. The training was organized in cooperation with <a href="http://www.sealcyprus.org" target="_blank">SEAL CYPRUS</a>, the Cyprus Organisation for Sustainable Education and Active Learning with support of the Erasmus+ Programme of the European Union.</p>

    <p>Entrepreneurship is  way to responding economic challenges, as well as civic engagement and participation. It’s a prerequisite to a smart society. At the same time we often see great ideas taking the back seat because their creators are afraid of failure and unknown. Many see entrepreneurship only as business and that’s why never make their ideas happen.  “Ideas are easy. Implementation is ART” – most of young entrepreneurs admit.</p>

    <p>The overall goal of the project was to bring together young entrepreneurs, youth leaders and youth workers from European organizations with main objective to equip young people with key skills, competencies and values in order to succeed in entrepreneurial activities with the use of arts.</p>

    <p>During the project the participants improved their skills and competencies certified with Youthpass, the European Certificate of non-formal education.</p>

    <p>The training developed and broadened the understanding of entrepreneurship, its dimensions and relations with the labour market. The participants develop their readiness to support their organisations in addressing unemployment and promoting entrepreneurship.</p>

    <p>As a result of this project, the participants and their organisations are now more prepared to encourage entrepreneurship among youth in an efficient way, as well as to organise quality projects within the Erasmus+ Program of the European Union and beyond.</p>
