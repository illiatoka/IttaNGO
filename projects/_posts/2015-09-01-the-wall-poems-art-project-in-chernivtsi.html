    <p class="title">How HCM Software Impacts the 3 Key Employee Engagement Drivers</p>

    <p>While many factors impact employee engagement, a <a href="#" target="_blank">study</a> by MSW Research and Dale Carnegie Training identified three key engagement drivers:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Relationship with immediate supervisor</li>
      <li>Pride in working for the company</li>
      <li>Belief in senior leadership</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Interestingly, although not having a reputation for supporting engagement, human capital management (HCM) software directly supports the first two drivers and prevents the third from being eroded by poor talent management practices.</p>

    <p>In other words, HCM software can be an important part of an employee engagement program. For an in-depth look at how, read our new article, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/resources/whitepapers/5-ways-human-capital-management-software-nurtures-employee-engagement/" rel="me">“5 Ways Human Capital Management Software Nurtures Employee Engagement”</a>.</p>

    <p><b>Here’s an overview of how HCM software impacts the key engagement drivers</b></p>

    <ul>
      <li><i class="icon-check"></i><b>Relationship with immediate supervisor</b>
        HCM tools improve communication, one of the most important factors impacting the employee-supervisor relationship. This relationship is critical, but can easily break down. Gallup <a href="#" target="_blank">estimates</a> that managers account for 70% of variance in employee engagement scores, and found in a <a href="#" target="_blank">study</a> that one in two U.S. adults “had left their job to get away from their manager” at some point in their career.
      </li>
      <li><i class="icon-check"></i><b>Pride in working for the company</b>
        HCM software can be used to help an employee feel connected with the culture, co-workers and your company. This impacts the employee’s daily experience of your workplace. A variety of research has shown that culture influences a variety of employee outcomes, including job satisfaction, employee trust, commitment, identification with the organization, engagement and overall relationship quality with the company. Meanwhile, best-selling author Kevin Sheridan has called co-worker satisfaction the <a href="#" target="_blank">“unsung hero”</a> of retention and employee engagement, noting that quality relationships with co-workers are what make “employees come to work, and even look forward to it.”
      </li>
      <li><i class="icon-check"></i><b>Belief in your company’s management</b>
        Few things erode employee confidence faster than being managed poorly. If your company’s managers aren’t using your HCM tools effectively or if your talent management processes are filled with problems and bottlenecks, employees will lose faith—not to mention productivity and motivation—no matter how much they like their work. HCM tools help you manage each employee efficiently throughout the entire talent management lifecycle. This creates the kind of employment experience that workers enthusiastically share on social sites, job boards and through word of mouth.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>So when considering HCM software, don’t just seek the usually associated benefits: faster and less labor-intensive talent management processes, streamlined workflows, improved communication, fewer data errors, and enhanced legal compliance.</p>

    <p>Also seek employee engagement.</p>
