    <p>The initiative of local community supported by NGO ITTA resulted in creating of a workout place and playground on unused piece of land near one of the apartment blocks.</p>

    <p>The aim of the project was to unite residents around the idea of transformation of the public space. During the project participants with assistance of the NGO learned how to work as a team, communicate with local authorities, fundraise and turn their ideas into a reality.  Now it is not only a place for kids and street workout but also for residents to organize their leisure. So far it has hosted a few movie screenings, workshops and a session of street university.</p>
