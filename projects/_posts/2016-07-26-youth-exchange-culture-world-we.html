    <p>From 26 July until 3 August 24 young people from Germany and Ukraine took part in the youth encounter Culture.World.We in Ukraine Working and hiking together, having fun, exchanging cultures and traditions, sharing smiles and international friendship will remain in our memories for a long time.</p>

    <p>During the encounter participants worked with creative media of theater and video. As a result of working together they have prepared six short videos about human rights issues. Check them out on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzp_jINTi9iw-fKm43AwDQ" target="_blank">Youtube Channel</a>.</p>

    <p>During the project we have as well worked on ideas about possible actions we could take in future. Based on the ideas of participants and cooperation with Volunteers of the project who came to learn more about organisation of international initiatives and exchanges we are going to prepare a follow-up.</p>

    <p>“It’s amazing how the group of young poeple grew together. It was exciting to see how they learn together, exchange and develop their ideas!” – Trainers of Culture.World.We. share their observations.</p>
